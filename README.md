🔍 Key Insights
✅ Churn Distribution
Basic count and percentage of customers who churned vs stayed.

✅ Senior Citizens
Senior citizens show different churn behavior than non-seniors.

✅ Tenure Impact
Tenure impacts churn — shorter tenures have higher churn.

✅ Contract Type
Customers with month-to-month contracts churn more frequently.

✅ Payment Methods
Electronic check users show a higher churn rate.

✅ Services
Services like OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, and Streaming influence churn likelihood.
